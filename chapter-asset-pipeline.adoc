[[asset-pipeline]]
= Asset Pipeline

The asset pipeline offers the Rails developer the opportunity of
delivering CSS, JavaScript and image files to the browser more optimally
- in other words, in a more compressed form and therefore more quickly.
Different CSS files are combined into one big file and delivered to the
browser with a fingerprint in the file name. This fingerprinting enables
the browser and any proxy in between to optimally cache the data, so the
browser can load these files more quickly.

NOTE: In case you are running on HTTP/2 is might be a good idea to
      break up this flow into smaller chunks to maximize caching.
      I will detail this in future versions of this book because
      most systems are still running on HTTP/1.1.

Within the asset pipeline, you can program CSS, SASS, JavaScript and
CoffeeScript extensively and clearly, in order to let them be delivered
later as automatically compressed CSS and JavaScript files.

As an example we use once more our web shop with a product scaffold:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails new webshop**
  [...]
$ **cd webshop**
$ **rails generate scaffold product name 'price:decimal{7,2}'**
  [...]
$ **rake db:migrate**
  [...]
$
----

In the directory `app/assets` you will then find the following files:

[subs=+quotes]
----
app/assets/
├── config
│   └── manifest.js
├── images
├── javascripts
│   ├── application.js
│   ├── cable.coffee
│   └── channels
└── stylesheets
    └── application.css
----

The files `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` and
`app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` are what is referred to as
manifest files. They automatically include the other files in the
relevant directory.

[[application.js]]
== application.js

The file `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` has the following
content:

[source,javascript]
.app/assets/javascripts/application.js
----
// [...]
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
----

In the `application.js`, the jQuery files defined in the `jquery`
gem are automatically integrated (for further information on jQuery,
please visit http://jquery.com/). Plus all other files in this directory
are integrated via `require_tree .` as shown above.

The not yet optimized result can be viewed in the development
environment at the URL http://localhost:3000/assets/application.js.

[[application.css]]
== application.css

The file `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` has the following
content:

[source,css]
.app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
----
/*
 * [...]
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_self
 */
----

With the command `require_tree .` all files in this directory are
automatically integrated.

[[rake-assetsprecompile]]
== rails assets:precompile

When using the asset pipeline, you need to remember that you have to
precompile the assets before starting the Rails server in the production
environment. This happens via the command `rails assets:precompile:`

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails assets:precompile**
I, [2015-12-01T12:08:50.495102 #54978]  INFO -- : Writing
/Users/xyz/webshop/public/assets/application-de26[...]fb6c.js
I, [2015-12-01T12:08:50.555494 #54978]  INFO -- : Writing
/Users/xyz/webshop/public/assets/application-2ce5[...]f443.css
----

If you forget to do this, you will find the following error message in
the log:

[source,log]
----
ActionView::Template::Error (application.css isn't precompiled)
----

The files created by `rails assets:precompile` appear in the directory
`public/assets`

[subs=+quotes]
----
public/assets
├── application-12b3c7dd74e9de7cbb1efa76a6d.css
├── application-12b3c7dd74e9de7cbb1efa76a6d.css.gz
├── application-723d1be6cc74abb1cec24276d681.js
├── application-723d1be6cc74abb1cec24276d681.js.gz
└── manifest-720d2116dee3d83d194ffd9d0957c21c.json
----

Go ahead and use your favorite editor to have a look at the created
`css` and `js` files. You will find minimized and optimized code.
If the web server supports it, the zipped `gz` files are delivered
directly, which speeds things up a bit more.

[NOTE]
====
The difference in file size is enormous. The file `application.js`
created in the development environment has a file size of 296 KB. The
file `js.gz` created by `rails assets:precompile` is only 88 KB.
Users of cellphones in particular will be grateful for smaller
file sizes.

The speed advantage incidentally lies not just in the file size, but
also in the fact that only one file is downloaded, not several.
The HTTP/1.1 overhead for loading a file is time-consuming. Things
are changing with HTTP/2. I'll update this chapter accordingly in
future editions of this book.

[[the-fingerprint]]
== The Fingerprint

The fingerprint in the file name consists of a hash sum generated from
the content of the relevant file. This fingerprint ensures optimal
caching and prevents an old cache being used if any changes are made to
the content. A simple but very effective method.

[[coding-links-to-an-asset]]
== Coding Links to an Asset

All files below the directory `app/assets` are delivered in normal
form by the Rails server. For example, you can go to the URL
http://localhost:3000/assets/rails.png to view the Rails logo saved
under `app/assets/images/rails.png` and to
http://localhost:3000/assets/application.js to view the content of
`app/assets/javascripts/application.js`. The Rails image `rails.png` is
delivered 1:1 and the file `application.js` is first created by the
asset pipeline.

But you should never enter these files as hard-wired in a view. To make
the most of the asset pipeline, you must use the helpers described here.

[[coding-link-to-an-image]]
== Coding Link to an Image

You can retrieve an image via the helper `image_tag`. This is what it
would look like in the view for the file `app/assets/images/rails.png`:

[source,erb]
----
<%= image_tag "rails.png" %>
----

In development mode, the following HTML code results from this:

[source,erb]
----
<img alt="Rails" src="/assets/rails.png" />
----

In production mode, you get an HTML code that points to a precompiled
file with fingerprint:

[source,erb]
----
<img alt="Rails" src="/assets/rails-be8732dac73d845ac5b142c8fb5f9fb0.png" />
----

[[coding-link-to-a-javascript-file]]
== Coding Link to a JavaScript File

You can use the helper `javascript_include_tag` to retrieve a JavaScript
file compiled by the asset pipeline. This is what it would look like in
the view for the file `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

[source,erb]
----
<%= javascript_include_tag "application" %>
----

In development mode, the following HTML code results from this:

[source,erb]
----
<link href="/assets/application.css?body=1" media="all" rel="stylesheet"
type="text/css" />
<link href="/assets/products.css?body=1" media="all" rel="stylesheet"
type="text/css" />
<link href="/assets/scaffolds.css?body=1" media="all" rel="stylesheet"
type="text/css" />
----

In production mode, you get an HTML code that points to a precompiled
file with fingerprint:

[source,erb]
----
<link href="/assets/application-0149f820dbdd285aa65e241569d8c256.css"
media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
----

[[coding-link-to-a-css-file]]
== Coding Link to a CSS File

A stylesheet compiled by the asset pipeline can be retrieved via the
helper `stylesheet_link_tag`. In the view, it would look like this for
the file `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

[source,erb]
----
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application" %>
----

In development mode, the following HTML code results from this:

[source,erb]
----
<script src="/assets/jquery.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/assets/jquery_ujs.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/assets/products.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/assets/application.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
----

In production mode, you get an HTML code that points to a precompiled
file with fingerprint:

[source,erb]
----
<script src="/assets/application-f8ca698e63b86d217c88772a65d2d20e.js"
type="text/javascript"></script>
----

[[defaults-in-the-application.html.erb]]
== Defaults in the application.html.erb

Incidentally, the file `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` that the
scaffold generator creates by default already contains the coding links
for these JavaScript and stylesheet files:

[source,erb]
.app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Webshop</title>
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= action_cable_meta_tag %>

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  </head>

  <body>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
