= Bundler and Gems

Gems constitute the package management in the world of Ruby.

TIP: If you do not have much time, you can skip this chapter for now
     and get back to it later if you have any specific questions.

If a Ruby developer wants to offer a specific feature or a certain
program or collection of programs to other Ruby developers, he can
create a "gem" from these. This gem can then be installed
via `gem install`.

NOTE: Have a look at https://www.ruby-toolbox.com to get an overview
      of the existing gems.

In a Rails project, different gems are used and a developer can also
add further gems. The programm `bundle` helps the
developer to install all these gems in the right version and to take
into account dependencies. In older Rails versions, you as
developer had to always call a `bundle install` after a `rails new`.
Now, this is done automatically within `rails new`.

The file `Gemfile` generated by `rails new` indicates which gems are
to be installed by Bundler:

[source,config]
.Gemfile
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'

# Bundle edge Rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails'
gem 'rails', '>= 5.0.0', '< 5.1'
# Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record
gem 'sqlite3'
# Use Uglifier as compressor for JavaScript assets
gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.3.0'
# Use CoffeeScript for .coffee assets and views
gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 4.1.0'
# See https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme for more supported runtimes
# gem 'therubyracer', platforms: :ruby

# Use jquery as the JavaScript library
gem 'jquery-rails'
# Turbolinks makes following links in your web application faster. Read more: https://github.com/rails/turbolinks
gem 'turbolinks'
# Build JSON APIs with ease. Read more: https://github.com/rails/jbuilder
gem 'jbuilder', '~> 2.0'
# Use Puma as the app server
gem 'puma'

# Use ActiveModel has_secure_password
# gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'

# Use Capistrano for deployment
# gem 'capistrano-rails', group: :development

group :development, :test do
  # Call 'byebug' anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console
  gem 'byebug'
end

group :development do
  # Access an IRB console on exception pages or by using <%= console %> in views
  gem 'web-console', '~> 3.0'
  # Spring speeds up development by keeping your application running in the background. Read more: https://github.com/rails/spring
  gem 'spring'
end

# Windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]
----

The format used is easy to explain: the word `gem` is followed by the
name of the gem and then, if required, a specification of the version of
the gem.

For example, the line `gem 'rails', '5.0.0'` stands
for "install the gem with the name `rails` in the version 5.0.0".

With `~>` before the version number you can determine that the newest
version after this version number should be installed. As a result, the
last digit is incremented, so for example `gem 'rails', '~> 4.0.0'`
would correspondingly install a Rails 4.0.1, but not a 4.1 (for the
latter, you would need to specify `gem 'rails', '~> 4.1'`).

NOTE: You have the option of installing certain gems only in certain
      environments. To do so, you need to enclose the corresponding
      lines in a `group :name do` loop.

Apart from the file `Gemfile` there is also the file `Gemfile.lock` and
the exact versions of the installed gems are listed there. In the above
example, it looks like this:

[source,config]
.Gemfile.lock
----
GEM
  remote: https://rubygems.org/
  specs:
    actioncable (5.0.0.1)
      actionpack (= 5.0.0.1)
      celluloid (~> 0.17.2)
      coffee-rails (~> 4.1.0)
      em-hiredis (~> 0.3.0)
      faye-websocket (~> 0.10.0)
      redis (~> 3.0)
      websocket-driver (~> 0.6.1)
    actionmailer (5.0.0.1)
      actionpack (= 5.0.0.1)
      actionview (= 5.0.0.1)
      activejob (= 5.0.0.1)
      mail (~> 2.5, >= 2.5.4)
      rails-dom-testing (~> 1.0, >= 1.0.5)
      [...]
----

The advantage of `Gemfile.lock` is that it makes it possible for several
developers to work on the same Rails project independently from one
another and to still be sure that they are all working with the same gem
versions. If a file is `Gemfile.lock`, this will be used by the Bundler.
This is also useful for deploying the Rails project later on a web
server.

Thanks to this mechanism you can use and develop several Rails projects
with different gem version numbers in parallel.

[[bundle-update]]
== bundle update

With `bundle update` you can update gems to new versions. As an example,
I have a Rails project with the Rails version 4.2.1:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails -v**
Rails 4.2.1
$
----

In the file `Gemfile`, this version is listed:

[source,config]
.Gemfile
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'

# Bundle edge Rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails'
gem 'rails', '4.2.1'
[...]
----

And also in the `Gemfile.lock`:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **grep 'rails' Gemfile.lock**
  [...]
  rails (= 4.2.1)
  [...]
$
----

Assumed we are working with rails 4.2.0 and we want to update to rails
4.2.4. Then we have to change the `Gemfile` from this:

[source,config]
.Gemfile
----
[...]
gem 'rails', '4.2.0'
[...]
----

to this:

[source,config]
.Gemfile
----
[...]
gem 'rails', '4.2.4'
[...]
----

After this change, you can use `bundle update rails` to install the new
Rails version (required dependencies are automatically taken into
account by Bundler):

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **bundle update rails**
  [...]
$ **rails -v**
Rails 4.2.4
$
----

IMPORTANT: After every gem update, you should first run `rake test`
           to make sure that a new gem version does not add any
           unwanted side effects.

[[bundle-outdated]]
== bundle outdated

If you want to know which of the gems used by your Rails project are now
available in a new version, you can do this via the command
`bundle outdated`. Example:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **bundle outdated**
Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...........
Fetching version metadata from https://rubygems.org/...
Fetching dependency metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
Resolving dependencies....

Outdated gems included in the bundle:
  * hiredis (newest 0.6.1, installed 0.5.2)
  * mime-types (newest 3.0, installed 2.99)
  * mini_portile2 (newest 2.1.0, installed 2.0.0)
----

To update them you'll have to change the version numbers in `Gemfile`
and run a `bundle update`.

[[bundle-exec]]
== bundle exec

`bundle exec` is required whenever a program such as `rake` is used
in a Rails project and is present in a different version than the
rest of the system. The resulting error message is always easy to
implement:

[subs=+quotes]
----
You have already activated rake 0.10, but your Gemfile requires rake 0.9.2.2.
Using bundle exec may solve this.
----

In this case, it helps to invoke the command with a preceding
`bundle exec`:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **bundle exec rake db:migrate**
----

[[binstubs]]
== binstubs

In some environments, using `bundle exec` is too complicated. In that
case, you can install programs with the correct version via
`bundle install --binstubs` in the directory bin:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **bundle install --binstubs**
Using rake 10.4.2
Using i18n 0.7.0
[...]
Using web-console 2.1.2
Bundle complete! 12 Gemfile dependencies, 54 gems now installed.
Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
----

Afterwards, you can always use these programs. Example:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **bin/rake db:migrate**
==  CreateUsers: migrating ====================================================
-- create_table(:users)
   -> 0.0018s
==  CreateUsers: migrated (0.0019s) ===========================================
